A 2-way voicing switch offers two distinct flavors of flanging: a traditional, full-frequency effect; or a more complex, notched flange effect with less low end. And when you need a vibrato effect instead of flanging, simply turn the feedback down to minimum and turn the D-F-V knob all the way up. Complete with an all-analog signal path, a relay-based soft switch, and an ultra-rugged, die-cast metal construction, the Walrus Audio Polychrome pedal will exceed your sonic expectations.",

A 3-way switch toggles between different clipping diodes, giving you a versatile array of tones. Beyond that, you get Level, Tone, and Distortion controls to shape your sound. With the Iron Horse, there's a flexible amount of gain on tap. This stompbox handles high-gain situations with ease, but back off the Distortion knob and it pulls double duty as a thick, warm overdrive. Complete with true-bypass switching, the Iron Horse V2 is perfect for any rock guitarist who's into chunky rhythms and blistering solos.",

First of all, the Deluxe extends its delay time up to 1.2s, and it maximizes every millisecond with tap tempo and a tap division feature. You can call up both the original Carbon Copy's darker tone or the vibrant articulation of the Bright version, and the Mod function's internal controls have been conveniently relocated to the top of the pedal. You also get an expression jack, programmable presets, and more. This is truly the ultimate Carbon Copy!",

The TC Electronic PolyTune 3 Noir Mini is just as fast, dependable, and intuitive as ever, boasting accuracy within 0.02 cents and delivering a no-nonsense approach to guitar and instrument tuning. Strum all strings* to see which ones are out of tune at a glance, or tune up one string at a time. The PolyTune 3 Mini automatically switches between mono and poly modes based on the incoming signal. And thanks to its built-in, high-quality-analog BonaFide Buffer (switchable to true bypass), the PolyTune 3 Mini can even improve your tone over extended cable runs. This means you get a bite, presence, and transient response that's much closer to plugging directly into an amp. But that's not all that's cool about the TC PolyTune 3 Mini. Alternate tuning modes make it fast and easy to explore new ways to craft your art, even in the middle of a frantic set. And an improved auto-dimming, 109-LED display makes tuning more comfortable in any environment, indoors or out.",

With the Bonsai, you truly get nine overdrive pedals packed into one housing.",

Many decades ago, adventurous guitarists in search of tonal nirvana found that the tube-driven audio section of that dusty old film projector in the attic made a fantastic guitar amp. This lore was not lost on the tone-chasers at Walrus Audio; and now we have the Walrus Audio 385, an overdrive pedal that models the tonal and drive characteristics of the tube audio circuit of a 1950s Bell and Howell 385 Filmosound projector. At Sweetwater, we love the Walrus Audio 385 — it's our kind of overdrive pedal. Dynamic, tubular, and amp-like, the 385 pedal is very responsive to your picking velocity and guitar's volume pot. Lean into it and up the grit; back off, and it cleans up nicely.",
