            <h3>Documentation of Development Process:</h3>
            <div class="about">
                <p class="about">
                    The intent of this website was to provide a virtual storefront for my Uncle's business, "Carlson's Guitar Pedal Emporium".  The business 
                    essentially buys and re-sells guitar effects pedals, with the main goal being to sell the pedals for a higher price than he purchased them for.
                    To ensure that I built a website that met those requirements, I wanted to focus on two main things:  Having a clean, welcoming design, as well as 
                    providing a lot of details about every product for sale.
                </p>
                <p class="about">
                    The clean design was accomplished by a simple color pallete and standardized navigation headers, making the site aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate.
                    The product detail was accomplished by including a wealth of information about each product, including images, demo videos, and detailed text descriptions.
                    Hopefully you will agree that the website has met our stated objectives!
                </p>

            <h3>Defense of Website Development Choices:</h3>
            <div class="about">
                <p class="about">
                    I feel the website is welcoming and engaging due to the use of a simple but effective color design, and the header navigation links.  While I will go into detail below
                    to describe each page in detail, I wanted to call out the navigation and color choices first, as those are the same/duplicated on each page.
                    The color scheme is fairly simple, with two muted blue colors and a light green.   This is easy on the eyes and doesn't detract from the main content of any page.
                    Likewise, the navigation headers are always present and always on the top of the page, ensuring the end user can easily find their way around the site without issue.
                    Another nice usability feature I added, as adding in a ":hover" CSS class on the navigation buttons, so that when a user hovers their mouse over them, they grow slightly
                    in size and change color, so the user can easily see what link they are about to click on.
                </p>
                <p class="about">
                    <b>HOME</b> - For the home page, I kept it very simple with a welcome paragraph, and also included a link directly to the Products page, hoping to draw the user there.
                    I additionally included two demo videos to hopefully grab the users attention!  This page is pretty straightforward.
                </p>
                <p class="about">
                    <b>ABOUT</b> - For the about page, I chose to center the content in the middle of the screen to make it front and center for the user.
                </p>
                <p class="about">
                    <b>PRODUCTS</b> - For the products page, I incorporated an unordered list, and removed the bullet-points normally found on such a list with CSS styles
                    I then made each "list entry" a DIV with with several text paragraphs and an image.  I included a border around the div to visually distinguish each item in the 
                    list from the others.  Another fun thing I added here which will make the site easier to use, is a search box.  Instead of the normal "enter text and hit search button" approach,
                    I utilized the "oninput" event on my textbox and some Javascript code to provide "real-time" searching, which I feel is a great feature!  And lastly, I implemented linking functionality
                    where a user can click on any list item and be taken to the product details page.
                </p>
                <p class="about">
                    <b>CONTACT</b> - For the contact page, I kept the same color themes and also centered all the form items in the middle of the screen to focus the user attention on them.
                    It's a pretty straightforward page, but I did add some error checking with Javascript to ensure that the user fills in all the necessary fields before submitting the form.
                </p>
                <p class="about">
                    <b>SUBSCRIBE</b> - For the subscribe page, I strived to make it as similar to the contact page as possible.  Both use the same color scheme, both use forms, both center 
                    the content in the middle of the screen, and both implement error checking before form submission.  This will make the website experience feel uniform to any end users
                </p>
                <p class="about">
                    <b>CART</b> - For the shopping cart page I chose to utilize a table to mimic what most users are used to seeing on a shopping cart page on an online web store.
                    It's very straightforward and easy to use, and I also chose to include the product image so the user could use that to help remember the item if they couldn't recall it 
                    based on the item name alone.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Opportunities for Improvement/Growth</h3>
            <div class="about">
                <p class="about">
                    The main area I would have focused on for improvement if I had more time was testing different screen resolutions and form-factors.  I made sure the website looked decent on both 
                    my 12" laptop screen, and my large 26" 4K monitor.  However, there are a TON of other form factors out there, such as mobile devices, tablets, screens with lower resolutions, etc.
                    If I had the time, I would've spent more time working on responsive design and CSS media queries to make the site look as good as possible in all screens/resolutions.
                </p>
                <p class="about">
                    One area where I could see spending some time on improving the website would be dynamically loading the product data from a service endpoint/API.  Right now, all the product
                    data is hard-coded in a JavaScript file - this is obviously not very maintainable in the long term.  Ideally, I'd have a backend server/database that would house the product information,
                    and then I'd just load that up from that endpoint and display it on this website.
                </p>
                <p class="about">
                    Lastly - this isn't really an improvement to the site, so to speak, but instead to the backend code.  For the dynamic pages that display products or product details 
                    (such as the Products page, Product Details page, and Shopping Cart pages), I was dynamically building HTML with jQuery.  This works, and for any user browsing the site, 
                    they wouldn't know or care about this.  But a better approach from a development/maintainability standpoint would be to integrate something with templating, such as 
                    Handlebars, React, or AngularJS.
